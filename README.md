## The project : A Machine Learning Approach for Sentiment Analysis of Spotify Reviews in the United Kingdom in 2024 [For Study Purpose]

## Project Description
This project is focusing on sentiment analysis by using machine learning on the most recent year of Spotify's reviews. 
There are five machine learning approaches that has been applied in this study which are Multinomial Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Random Forest. However, the project selected the best model out of 5 approaches to perform further process which is aspect-based sentiment analysis. The most interesting 5 topic from each polarity will be chosen to analysis in this project. 

## In this project contains:
- Dataset
- Applying machine learning approaches for sentiment analysis : It consist of 5 approaches, there are Multinomial Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Random Forest.
- Key apects of each polarity: By using Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA)

## Findings
After gathering data and preprocessing, the Spotify application has an average score of 2.38 out of 5 by including both Andriod and iOS users. The unexpected results show that more than half have rated the application as 1-star, followed by 5-star, 4-star, 2-star, and 3-star. Spotify is the biggest music streaming platform, and the unexpected outcomes needed to be clarified by figures insightful of the dataset. Then, multiple machine-learning approaches are applied to the dataset to perform sentiment analysis. To evaluate different machine-learning approaches, AUC-ROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) is being used to compare scores among those models. As a result, the best approach to machine learning that could provide the most appropriate by having the highest score of 0.96 is Support Vector Machine (SVM), followed by Multinomial Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Stochastic Gradient Descent. Then, aspects-based sentiment analysis analyses the top 50 aspects of each polarity.
