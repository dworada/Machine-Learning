## The project : A Machine Learning Approach for Sentiment Analysis of Spotify Reviews in the United Kingdom 

## Project Description
This project is focusing on sentiment analysis by using machine learning on the most recent year of Spotify's reviews. 
There are five machine learning approaches that has been applied in this study which are Multinomial Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Random Forest. However, the project selected the best model out of 5 approaches to perform further process which is aspect-based sentiment analysis. The most interesting 5 topic from each polarity will be chosen to analysis in this project. 

## In this project contains:
- Dataset : the repository has two dataset which is the raw dataset (as Spotify Dataset.zip), and the preprocessing data set (as Spotify_preprocessing_data.zip). Also, It can found in One drive as https://universityofexeteruk-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/wn258_exeter_ac_uk/EiA5mKDUQv1HkjOAJQSdb0MBmHjyxv9B5ISf41gef7VkmA?e=RxnJMq on both raw data as 'Spotify review data.csv' and cleaned data as 'data_preprocessing_spotify.csv'.
- Applying machine learning approaches for sentiment analysis : It consist of 5 approaches, there are Multinomial Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Random Forest.
- Key apects of each polarity: By using Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA)
